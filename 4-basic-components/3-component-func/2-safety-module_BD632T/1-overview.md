# 4.3.2.1. Overview

To meet the requirement of PLr=d cat3 (SIL2) in compliance with ISO 13849-1, the safety module (BD632T) is designed in a dualized safety electric circuit and continuously monitors the status of safety-related inputs. If a system error or safety-related input is detected, this safety module renders the robot into a safe state by cutting off the motor power and brake power according to the classification of the types of the stops determined through risk assessment.
