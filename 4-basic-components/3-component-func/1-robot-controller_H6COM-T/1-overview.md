# 4.3.1.1. Overview

H6COM-T is structured as shown in Figure 4.3, combining the main CPU board and the carrier board. The main CPU board consists of a SSD slot, a CPU slot, a memory card slot, a DP port, a COM port, and a bus connector connecting the carrier board. The carrier board includes three external LAN ports, two LAN ports for internal system, two USB ports, one GPIO port, two PCI connectors, one PCI-e connector, and one DC 24V power connector.  The LAN ports for internal systems are used for the EtherCAT communication and for the interface with the teach pendant, and the GPIO  port is used for the detection of the power failure signal from the power system. The DP port and USB ports are used for debugging. To support other general-purpose bus interfaces, a PCI expansion slot and three additional external LAN ports are provided, and, through relevant slots, connection to other communication interfaces, other than the EtherCAT, can be made.
