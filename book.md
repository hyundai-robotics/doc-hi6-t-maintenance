# Hi6-T Controller Maintenance Manual

## Overview

The main purpose of this chapter is to describe the matters about the safety for the users of the industrial robot and for the workers who maintain and operate the robot.

Every worker who installs, replaces, adjusts, operate, preserves and maintains the robot system must carefully read and fully understand the operation manual and maintenance manual. Also, keep the manuals nearby so that you can view it whenever necessary.

Our company plans and implements the preservation, maintenance and operation trainings so the person using the robot should ensure that the workers working in the robot system should receive the relevant trainings. It must be ensured that only those who have completed this course can handle the robot.

The users of our industrial robots are responsible for surely understanding and complying with safety-related laws applicable in concerned countries and for properly designing, installing, and operating safety devices to protect workers working in robot systems.

The dangerous areas of the robot system, in other words, the areas where the robot, tools and peripheral devices are operating, should be equipped with safety devices according to ANSI / RIA R15.06-2012 to prevent an object, other than the workers and the workpiece, from entering the dangerous areas. The robot system should be configured in a way that it can be stopped immediately by an emergency stop device when a worker or object needs to enter the dangerous area in spite of possible danger. The workers are responsible for installing, checking and operating these safety devices.

# 1.4. Risk Assessment

When it comes to configuring an integrated system including a robot, risk assessment is one of the most critical factors that are handled as legal requirements in most countries. A risk assessment of an integrated system cannot be performed only on a single robot because the safety assessment for the installation of the will differ depending on how the robot is integrated into the system.

The system administrator should configure and operate the system according to the guidelines of ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 to conduct a risk assessment.
You should conduct the risk assessment by taking into account the entire process of an integrated system including the robot. The main objectives of the risk assessment are as follows.

* Basic settings for the use of the robot, and teaching of the robot
* Trouble diagnosis, and maintenance
* Normal operation of the installed robot

After installing the robot and configuring the s
ystem, you must conduct a risk assessment. The risk assessment mainly determines the appropriateness of safety devices in the robot integrated system, as well as the necessity for additional emergency stop devices and other safety devices. It is very important to know the appropriate safety devices and properly configure the robot integrated system. You should configure the integrated system by referring to the relevant information in the manual. For details on configuring the safety functions, refer to “1.8. Safety Functions”. In addition, when installing the robot in a specific location or configuring safety-related functions by using the safety I/O, the important items in the risk assessment of an integrated robot system are as follows.

* Severity
* Frequency of exposure to risks
* Possible occurrence
* Possible avoidance

In the process of configuring an integrated system, if the safety-related functions of the robot do not sufficiently eliminate the risk factors, it is possible to check the necessity for additional protective devices during the risk assessment.

# 1.5. Potential Risks

If the results of the risk assessment of an integrated system linked to the robot reveal that the risk factors have not been sufficiently removed only with the safety-related functions of the robot, additional protective measures must be taken.
The items to take into consideration when establishing additional protective measures is as follows.
* During installation, fingers can be pinched (caught) between the robot base and the mounting table.
* Injuries (puncture wound, penetrating injury, etc.) from sharp edges or pointed parts of obstacles or tools in the operation area.
* Injuries (bruise, falling over, fracture, etc.) due to collision with the robot
* Injuries caused (puncture wound, penetrating injury, fracture, etc.) due to obstacles around the robot
* Injuries that may occur because the fastening part is not completely fixed
* Injuries (skin damage, shortness of breath, etc.) that may occur when working with toxic and hazardous substances
* Separation of a workpiece from the tool due to sudden power failure
* A mistake caused by confusing with the emergency stop switch of other equipment
* Errors due to arbitrary change of the setting of safety-related functions.
The type of risk that may occur depends on the system configuration, so you must conduct the risk assessment before using the integrated system.
# 1.6. Effectiveness and Responsibility

It is required to observe the safety requirements according to the safety regulations and laws of the countries and regions where the robot is installed and used. Suppliers and users of the robot integrated systems have a variety of responsibilities, including the following items.
*	Risk assessment of the robot integrated system
*	Addition and removal of safety devices according to the risk assessment results
*	Check whether the integrated system is configured, installed and set up correctly.
*	Establishment of the methods and guidelines to use the integrated system, and trainings for the users
*	Management of safety devices (Prohibition of user's arbitrary change and manipulation of safety devices)
*	Provision of important information, as well as contact information, related to the use and safety of the product
*	Provision of all kinds of technical documents including manuals

The safety information in this manual does not cover all risk factors and situations that may arise while using the product.

# 1.7. Safety Labels 

Name plates, warning markings, safety symbols, etc. are attached on the inside and outside of the controller. Any act of damaging the safety labels, such as relocating the name plates, warning markings, safety symbols, name markings and wire markings or painting over them or blocking them with a cover is prohibited.

{% endhint %}# 1.8 Safety Functions

The safety system of the robot is designed in dual configuration (HFT=1) to satisfy the safety performance (PL) = d Cat3 of [ISO13849-1:2015] and the safety integrity level (SIL) 2 of [IEC62061:2005], and continuously monitors the status of safety related devices. When an error is detected by self-diagnosis, or a safety related signal is inputted, the safety functions will stop the robot according to the classification of stop situations determined based on the risk assessment. Also, when any of the dual switches of the safety circuit is activated, the motor drive power and brake drive power will be cut off by the safety functions to secure a safe state. Information on the relevant status can be checked through the Teach pendant.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure that the safety circuit is never ignored, modified or altered in any way.
{% endhint %}

The safety-related main functions of the robot are as follows.
# 1.8.1. Main Safety Functions

* Emergency stop (IEC 60204-1,10,7)

There is one emergency stop button on the controller and teach pendant respectively. It is possible to connect, if necessary, an additional emergency button to the safety chain circuit of the robot. The emergency stop function is to be applied with higher priority over all other control functions of the robot. The function will immediately cut off the power supply to the motors of individual axes of the robot, stopping the robot and making it impossible to use safety related functions controlled by the robot.


{% hint style="주의" %}
As the emergency stop function immediately cuts off the motor power, so reckless use of the function may result in accumulation of fatigue that affects the durability of the robot. The function must be used only in emergency situations.
{% endhint %}

![](../../_assets/그림_1.3_추가_비상정지_장치_연결.png  )

Figure 1.3 Connection of an Additional Emergency Stop Device

*	Protective stop (ISO 10218-1:2011)

The robot should have multiple safety inputs so that it can be used in connection with external safety devices such as safety guards, safety pads, and safety lamps. These safety inputs will make the robot stop when there is an input from the robot itself and peripheral facilities, securing a safe state. For details on the connection to the safety inputs, refer to “4.3.2. Safety Module (BD632)”.

*   Speed limit (EN ISO 10218-1:2011)

In manual operation mode, the speed of the robot is limited to a maximum of 250 mm / s. The speed limit applies not only to the TCP (Tool Center Point) but also to all other parts of the robot that are to be operated in manual mode. It should be also made possible to monitor the speed of the equipment mounted on the robot.

*  Operation area limit (ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012)

When applying a robot, in order to secure a sufficient safety area, the operation range of the robot can be limited by using a hardware limit or a stopper. This function can minimize the damage if the robot collides with an external safety device such as a safety guard. Axis 1, 2, and 3 are mainly limited by a stopper or hardware limit. If the operation range is changed due to a mechanical stopper or hardware limit, the operation range limit parameter should be also changed in software as well. Please refer to the operation manual about the change. The operation area limit of each axis can be changed by the user, and at the time of shipment, it is set to the maximum operation range of the robot. The safety system of the Hi6 controller can support up to 4 hardware limit switches as an option. Refer to “4.3.2. Please refer to “Safety Module (BD632)” for the matters related to the connection.

*  Operation mode selection (ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012)

You can operate the robot in manual, automatic or remote mode. The maximum speed in manual mode is limited to 250 mm/s, and you can perform operation only with the Teach pendant. In addition, it is possible to mount a mode switch additionally on the control panel by configuring it as an option. For details on the operation, please refer to the operation manual.

# 1.8.2. Other Related Functions

Required to fully understand the following items and take actions if a person is pinched due to an accident caused by the arm of the robot.

* Release of the manual brake 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Considering that additional problems may occur due to gravity or brake release, you must take a measure, before carrying out works, such as using a rope and crane that are to used for transportation of individual robots to prevent the brake from running down or additional accidents from taking place during the release of the brake.
{% endhint %}

    - After removing power from the controller, connect the brake release unit to the designated connector of the robot or the internal board connector of the controller and then release the manual brake for each axis as needed.

    - Refer to the maintenance manual of each robot for the information on individual axes of each robot, and for the designated transport equipment (ex: rope, crane) for each robot.

When the robot is stopped by the limit switch, it is possible to change the position by jogging the robot with the Teach pendant in the constant setting mode. After designating the soft limit according to the site situation, make sure that it is installed by a trained worker.

{% hint style="info" %}
Our company is not responsible if the jogging operation does not work due to the failure of the hardware limit switch. 
You must check it periodically. For the measure to take in case of a failure, please refer to the troubleshooting manual.
{% endhint %}
# 1.9. Stop

The safety system of Hi6-T15 controller can handle the stop operation as shown below. Safety inputs can be classified as follows according to the stop classification criteria specified in IEC 60204-1.

*  Stop classification Stopping (uncontrolled stoping) occurs as the power to the machine actuator is immediately removed.

    →  Emergency stop button

*  Stop classification 1: Controlled stop in which the machine actuator still has a power that can be used to achieve the stopping. The power will be removd when the stopping is achieved. 

    →  Safety inputs except for the emergency stop button
# 1.10. Safety Measures When Installing
# 1.10.1. Installing the Safety Guard

{% hint style="warning" %}
When the robot is operating, there is a risk of collision between the robot and the worker. Therefore, install a safety fence to prevent a worker from getting close to the robot.
{% endhint %}

When the robot is operating, there is a risk of collision between the robot and the worker. Therefore, install a safety fence to prevent a worker from getting close to the robot according to ISO 13855:2010. Configure the system to ensure that the robot stops when a worker opens the door of the safety fence and approaches the facility, during the robot operation, for any reason, such as inspecting the robot or a welding fixture, performing tip dressing or tip changing, etc.

Source : ISO 13855:2010 Safety of machinery - Positioning of safeguards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body

*   The safety fence should cover the operation area of the robot, and should secure enough space so that there is no interference when the worker carries out works, such as teaching, maintenance,  etc. The safety fence should be made solid to prevent it from being moved easily and should be structured in a way not to allow people to enter inside the fence by going over the safety fence.

*	In principle, it is required to install and use a fixed type safety fence that does not have dangerous parts such as uneven or sharp parts.

*	An entrance door should be installed to allow people to enter inside the safety fence, and a safety plug must be installed on the door in a way that the door should not open unless the plug is removed. In addition, wiring should be configured in a way that allows the motor to be turned off and the brake to be in hold state when the safety plug is removed or the sfety fence is opened.

*	If you want to operate the robot even when the safety plug is removed, wiring should be configured in a way that allows the robot to play back at low speed.

*	Install the emergency stop button of the robot at a location where the operator can quickly press it.

*	If a safety fence is not to be installed, safety devices such as photoelectric switches and mat switches should be installed covering the entire area that falls within the specification of the safety guard range of the robot, as substitute devices for the safety fence, making it possile for the robot to stop automatically when a person enters inside the safety fence. 

*	Make sure that the robot's operation area (danger area) can be identified in some way, such as painting the floor.

# 1.10.2. Placement of the Robot and Peripheral Devices 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The robot should be installed and operated according to the guidelines of ISO 10218-2. In addition, it is required to comply with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws. 
Our company (or the manufacturer) will not be responsible for any accidents that occur due to not complying with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws or due to not reviewing the “risk assessment”.

{% endhint %}

Installation of the product should be performed by a qualified installer according to relevant national and local regulations and laws.

*	Put up a sign “No entry during operation” at the entrance of the safety fence, and inform the workers of the intents.

*	Place the controller, interlock panels, and other control panels in a way that they can be operated from outside the safety fence.

*	When installing the operation stand, attach an emergency stop button to it also. Wherever you operate the robot, you should be able to stop the robot in an emergency situation.

*	Do not allow the wiring or piping of the manipulator, controller, interlock panel, timer, etc. to get caught on by the workers' feet or to get stepped on directly by the forklift. Otherwise, there is a risk of accidents of the worker getting electric shock or the wires getting disconnected. 

*	Place the controller, interlock panel, and operation stand at a place where the operation of the manipulator can be seen sufficiently. If the robot is operating abnormally in an area from which the robot operation cannot be seen, or the worker is working on something in the area, there is a risk of major accidents taking place during operation.

*	If the required robot operation area is narrower than the allowable robot operation area, you should limit the robot operation area. It can be limited by soft limit, hardware limit, mechanical stopper, etc. Even when the robot operates off the normal operation area due to abnormal operation such as mistakes in the operation of the robot, the robot will be stopped in advance by the operation area limit function. 

*	During welding, spatter may fall on or fall near the worker and cause a burn or fire. Install a light shield plate, cover, etc. in the range where the movement of the manipulator can be seen sufficiently.

*	When it comes to a device that shows the auto and manual operation modes of the robot, an easily visible device should be installed to ensure that the status can be recognized from a distance. In case of starting the operation in auto mode, a buzzer or an alarm will be useful.

*	Make sure there is no protruding part on the peripheral devices of the robot. If necessary, place a cover on them. Otherwise, in general, an accident could occur when the worker comes into contact with a protruding part, and a major accident could occur when a worker surprised over a sudden movement of the robot could fall over. 

*	Do not design a system that requires the worker to put in hands inside the safety fence to carry in and carry out a workpiece.

# 1.10.3. Installation of the Robot

{% hint style="warning" %}
The robot should be installed and operated according to the guidelines of ISO 10218-2. In addition, it is required to comply with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws. 
Our company (or the manufacturer) will not be responsible for any accidents that occur due to not complying with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws or due to not reviewing the “risk assessment”.
{% endhint %}

Installation of the product should be performed by a qualified installer according to relevant national and local regulations and laws.

*	When unpacking the product, check it for damage that may occur while transporting or unpacking it.

*    Before installing the product after unpacking it, you must check the safety regulations, instructions, information related to the product installation and use environments, and fully understand the installation methods.

*	The worker who uses the robot should fully understand the contents described in the application and auxiliary manuals, and operate and handle the industrial robot skillfully.
*	The worker who installs the robot should be able to apply the safety instructions during the installation if there is a problem.
*	The system supplier should guarantee that all circuits used for safety functions perform their functions surely.
*	The main power supply to the robot should be installed in a way that it can be cut off from outside the robot operation area.
*	The system supplier should surely guarantee that all circuits used for safety functions perform their functions safely.
*	The emergency stop button should be located at a place where the worker can easily approach it when required to stop the robot urgently. 
*	By taking into consideration the dimensions of the manipulator and the operation range, make sure that that there is no interference with peripheral devices.
*	Avoid installing the robot in a place that is exposed to direct sunlight, has high level of humidity, has oil or chemicals around and has lots of metal powder or explosive gas in the air.
*	Install the robot in an area where the ambient temperature is 0 - 45 ℃.
*	Secure enough space for disassembling and inspecting the robot easily.
*	Install a safety fence and prevent people from entering the robot operation range.
*	Make sure there is no obstacle in the robot operation area.
*	When installing the robot in an area exposed to direct sunlight or near a heating element, you should take measures in consideration of the thermodynamic state of the controller.
*	Take additional measures when installing the robot in an area that has lots of dust such as metal powder in the air.
*	Carry out installation in a way that welding current never flows to the robot. In other words, there should be insulation between the spot gun and the wrist of the robot. 
*	Since grounding is important for preventing a malfunction due to noise and an electric shock, you should install the robot as shown below.

     - Install the dedicated grounding terminal while setting it as Type 3 Grounding higher.
     - Connect the grounding wire to the grounding bus bar inside the control panel.
     - When the manipulator is installed, if it is directly grounded to the floor by an anchor, etc., the controller side and the manipulator side will make a two-point grounding, forming a closed circuit, which conversely may cause malfunctioning due to some reasons such as noise. In this case, connect the grounding wire to the base part of the manipulator, but not to the controller side. In addition, if there is shaking when the robot stops, there is a high possibility that the grounding is incomplete or there is a closed circuit. It is required to check the grounding again.
     - If you use a gun with an embedded transformer, there is a risk of dropping because the primary power cable is connected directly to the spot gun. In this case, in order to protect the control panel and prevent electric shock, connect the grounding wire directly to the base part of the manipulator and do not connect it to the controller.<br/><br/>

* Carry out the installation by referring to the robot maintenance manual for each robot.
* After designating the soft limit suitable for the site situation, the positioning  and adjustment of the hardware limit must be performed by a trained worker. After installation, you must check whether the functions are working well.
# 1.11. Safety Works When Operating the Robot



{% hint style="warning" %}
Must observe safety work procedures to prevent safety accidents. Do not change or ignore safety devices or circuits under any circumstances, and pay attention to possible electric shock. 
In auto mode, all normal works should be performed outside the safety guard. Before carrying out works, you must make sure that there are no people in the operation area of the robot.
{% endhint %}
# 1.11.1. Safety Measures When Operating the Robot 

Observe the following measures considering that safety is very important when operating the robot.
*	The worker who operates or may operate the robot, and the supervisor should take certain trainings. Except for those who are recognized to be fully aware of the safety and functions of the robot and designated accordingly, any unqualified person should not operate the robot.

*	Before operating the robot, you must check whether the product has been installed by a qualified installer in compliance with the relevant national and regional regulations and laws.

*	Before operating the robot, check whether the safety functions are working normally.

*	Must wear a safety helmet, protective glasses and safety shoes. 

*	Two people must work together. One person should be teaching and the other should be monitoring from the operation panel. One of the two should be ready to press the emergency stop switch at any time, and the other should perform the work quickly with sufficient care in the operation area. In addition, check the evacuation route before starting the work. 

*	Supply the power after confirming that there is no worker within the safety guard.

*	Works such as teaching should be performed outside the robot safety guard in principle. However, when required to stop the system and work within the operation range, the worker should bring in the mode switch key (or a switch to change to the auto mode), or the safety plug when going inside. Such action is necessary to make sure that no other worker accidentally changes the robot to the auto operation mode. Also, pay special attention to the direction of the operation of the robot just in preparation for the robot malfunctioning or operating in wrong conditions.

※   The supervisor should observe the followings.
            
    - The supervisor should be positioned at a location where she or he can see the robot entirely and should be dedicated to the duties of supervision.
    - If there is any problem, press the emergency stop button immediately.
    - Other people except for the persons involved in the work should not be allowed to stay within the operation range.

* In manual operation mode, the speed should be limited to a maximum of 250 mm/sec. At this time, you should progress the work while being prepared, together with the worker outside the guard, to press the emergency stop switch at any time if a problem occurs.

*	When operating the robot manually in high-speed mode, you should progress the operation from outside the safety guard.

*	When performing a teaching work, you should put up a sign [Teaching in progress]. 

*	When required to enter inside the safety guard, the worker should pull out the safety plug or an equivalent, and then bring it in when going inside.

*	Do not use equipment that could be a source of noise near the teaching place or its surroundings.

*	Do not operate the robot operation buttons on the teach pendant just by using the feeling at the hands while watching the teaching points. Instead, operate the buttons while checking with bare eyes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sufficiently check under your feet when teaching. In particular, you must perform the teaching work outside the safety guard when teaching at a high speed (250mm/s or above).
{% endhint %}

* 	Take the following measures when abnormality occurs.
이
     - 	If abnormal operation is found, immediately press the emergency stop button.

     - 	If abnormality is to be checked following an emergency stop, the stop status of the concerned facility must be checked.

     - 	If the robot stops automatically due to abnormality with the power. Check first that the robot is stopped completely, and then investigate the cause and take measures.

     - 	If the emergency stop device does not perform functions properly, immediately shut off the main power, and then investigate the cause and take measures.

     - 	The investigation of the cause of the abnormality should not be performed by any other than the designated person. After the emergency stop, you should restart the system after surely identifying the cause of the abnormality and taking measure accordingly.

* 	Prepare proper work regulations, considering the installation location and work details, with regard to the robot operation and manipulation methods, and actions to take when abnormality occurs. In addition, work should be carried out according to the work regulations.
*	Precautions to take when the robot is stopped

    * Must avoid approaching the robot recklessly while thinking that the robot is stopped. When you approach the robot because you think it is stopped, the robot may suddenly move, causing an accident in many cases. The robot will be in the stopped state in the following cases.<br/><br/>

You should not be negligent in paying attention to sudden movements even when entry is made possible. Must avoid approaching without preparing for possible emergency situation under any circumstances.
{% endhint %}

  
    - If the entrance door needs to be opened to take measures for minor abnormalities (such as nozzle contact, deposition detection and arc abnormality) during a temporary stop, the same measures as taken for opening the door for the teaching should be taken.

* After completing the robot operation, clean the inside of the safety fence to make sure that no tools, oil or foreign substances remain. If the operation area is stained with oil, or if tools are left in the operation area, it could cause an accident such as falling over. Make sure that arranging and organizing are performed always.
# 1.11.2. Safety Measures When Trial-Operating the Robot

{% hint style="info" %}
In the case of trial-operation, there may be a design error, a teaching error, or a defect in manufacturing with regard to the entire system including the teaching program, jigs, and sequencing. For this reason, you should work with elevated safety awareness in trial-operation. Multiple factors can contribute to safety accidents. Observe the following measures considering that safety is very important when trial-operating the robot.
{% endhint %}

* 	Before operating the robot, check the functions of buttons such as the emergency stop button and the stop button as well as the functions of relevant signals. After that, check the operation related to detection of abnormality. First of all, it is important to check all the signals that stop the robot. When an accident is expected, the most important thing is to stop the robot.

*	When performing trial operation  of the robot, first set it to manual mode, input a job program with which you can test all axes, and then check the operation by repeating more than 1 cycle for each step While the robot is moving, open the safety guard or remove the enabling switch (enabling switch on the Teach pendant) to see whether the robot stop. If a problem is found, press the emergency stop button to check whether the robot stops. If the emergency stop device does not perform its function well, immediately shut off the main power. After that, you should call the responsible aftersales person. If there is no problem, increase the speed in sequence (50% → 75% → 100%), and check the operation by repeating more than 1 cycle each. Operating at high speed from the beginning may lead to a major accident.

*	It is not possible to predict what kind of problem will occur during trial-operation. Never enter inside the safety fence during trial-operation. As the reliability is low, it is very likely that unexpected accidents could occur

# 1.11.3. Safety Measures for Auto Operation

Observe the following measures considering that safety is very important when operating the robot in auto mode.

* 	Put up a sign [No entry during operation] on the safety fence entrance and ask the worker to refrain from entering during operation. If the robot is stopped, you may enter inside the safety fence after judging the situation. 

*	When starting the auto operation, you must check whether there is a worker inside the safety fence. If you work without checking whether there is a worker inside, it may cause an accident involving people. 

*	When starting the auto operation, check first that that the program number, step number, mode, start selection, etc. are in proper state for auto operation. If you start the robot while an irrelevant program or step is selected, the robot may behave unexpectedly causing an accident. 

*	When starting the auto operation, check in advance that the robot is in the position where the robot can start the auto operation. Check also whether the program number or step number matches with the robot position. Even when the program or step is correct, if the robot is in a different position, an accident may occur due to an operation different from a normal operation 

*	Be prepared to press the emergency stop button immediately at the start of auto operation. If an unexpected robot operation or unexpected situation occurs, immediately press the emergency stop button. 

*	Check the operation path, operation status, and operation sound, etc. of the robot to judge whether there is any abnormal state. The robot may suddenly cause an abnormality such as a failure, but it may give some symptoms before the failure occurs. In order to predict this in advance, it is required to well understand the normal operation status of the robot. 

*	If any abnormality is found, immediately make an emergency stop and take proper measure for it. Using the robot without proper measures could lead to a severe failure that may lead to production interruption and significant accidents involving people. 

*	While completing measures and checking the operation after an abnormality occurred, do not operate the robot while the worker is still inside the safety fence. Unexpected accidents such as other abnormalities may occur as the reliability is low. 

*	Before selecting the auto mode, if there is a safety device function that has been stopped, you should progress works after recovering the function back to completely normal state.
# 1.12. Safety Measures When Entering Inside the Safety Fence

When required to enter the safety door in the robot operation area, a worker and a super visor who have received certain trainings should perform works in a group of two. Also, they must wear a safety helmet, protective glasses and safety shoes. The supervisor should be prepared to press the emergency stop switch at any time, and the worker must bring in the teach pendant when going inside, making impossible for other people to operate the robot. Must put up a sign on the control panel to indicate that the robot is being operated.

# 4.3.1. Robot Controller (H6COM-T)
# 4.3.1.1. Overview

H6COM-T is structured as shown in Figure 4.3, combining the main CPU board and the carrier board. The main CPU board consists of a SSD slot, a CPU slot, a memory card slot, a DP port, a COM port, and a bus connector connecting the carrier board. The carrier board includes three external LAN ports, two LAN ports for internal system, two USB ports, one GPIO port, two PCI connectors, one PCI-e connector, and one DC 24V power connector.  The LAN ports for internal systems are used for the EtherCAT communication and for the interface with the teach pendant, and the GPIO  port is used for the detection of the power failure signal from the power system. The DP port and USB ports are used for debugging. To support other general-purpose bus interfaces, a PCI expansion slot and three additional external LAN ports are provided, and, through relevant slots, connection to other communication interfaces, other than the EtherCAT, can be made.

# 4.3.2.5. Connections of the Emergency Stop

(1\)  External Emergency Stop of Contact Input Type 

The external emergency stop (EMEX) is designed in a way that it can be operated regardless of the controller mode (automatic or manual) and is continuously monitored by the BD632 (Safety IO Board). When a safety input is coming in, the motor power will be shut off to put the robot in a safe state. The external emergency stop switch should be connected and used in the form of contact output, as shown in the figure below.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.32_터미널블록_TBEM에_외부비상정지_스위치를_연결하는_방법.png  )

Figure 4.9 Method to Connect the External Emergency Stop Switch to the Terminal Block TBEM

If the external emergency stop is not to be used, connect the terminals of the terminal block TBEM (connect the pins 9-1 and 10-2 of the TBEM connector), as shown below, to disable the input.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.25_BD632(Safety_IO_Board)_TBEM.png  )

Figure 4.10 Method to Perform When Not Using the External Emergency Stop of Contact Input Type

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an external emergency stop is to be installed and used, the robot should be operated after confirming that the emergency stop operates normally. In addition, check if the emergency stop input is disabled. This is an essential measure that must be taken in advance for the safety of workers.
{% endhint %}
# 4.3.2.6. Connection of the Safety Guard 

(1\) General Safety Guard

The general safety guard operates regardless of the controller's mode (automatic or manual). In other words, when a person enters inside the installed safety guard or when the guard is broken, the controller will immediately shut off the motor power. The safety guard that can be used should be in the form of contact output. In the terminal block TBEM, terminals are configured in a way that they connect the contact outputs of the safety guard to the dual safety chain, as shown in the figure below.



![](../../../_assets/그림_4.34_터미널블록_TBRMT에_일반_안전가드를_연결하는_방법.png  )

Figure 4.11 Method to Connect a General Safety Guard to the Terminal Block TBRMT

If the general safety guard is not to be used, connect the terminals (pins 15-7 and 16-8) of the terminal block TBEM, as shown below, to disable the input.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.25_BD632(Safety_IO_Board)_TBEM.png  )

Figure 4.12 Method to Perform When Not Using a General Safety Guard

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a general safety guard is to be installed and used, the robot should be operated after confirming that the emergency stop operates normally. In addition, check if the emergency stop input is disabled. This is an essential measure that must be taken in advance for the safety of workers.
{% endhint %}

\(2\) Automatic Safety Guard of Contact Input Type 

The automatic safety guard operates only when the controller is in the automatic mode and provides two inputs, as shown below. Like a general safety guard, the automatic safety guard should be in the form of contact output. In the terminal block TBEM, terminals are configured in a way that they connect the contact outputs of the safety guard to the dual safety chain, as shown in the figure below.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.36_터미널블록_TBEM에_접점입력_자동_안전가드를_연결하는_방법.png  )

Figure 4.13 Method to Connect an Automatic Safety Guard of Contact Input Type to the Terminal Block TBEM

If the automatic safety guard is not to be used, connect the terminals of the terminal block TBEM((pins 11-3, 12-4, 13-5 and 14-6), as shown below, to disable the input.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.25_BD632(Safety_IO_Board)_TBEM.png  )

Figure 4.14 Method to Perform When Not Using an Automatic Safety Guard of Contact Input Type

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an automatic safety guard is to be installed and used, the robot should be operated after confirming that the emergency stop works normally. In addition, check if the emergency stop input is disabled. This is an essential measure that must be taken in advance for the safety of workers.
{% endhint %}
# 4.3.2.7. Connection of the Safety PLC/IO

The emergency input signal and monitoring output signal between the safety PLC or IO, and the robot controller should be connected in the following way.

![](../../../_assets/그림_4.38_Safety_PLC,IO의_연결방법.png  )

Figure 4.15 Method to Connect the Safety PLC/IO

\(1\) P-COM Input and Safety Input 

The safety inputs (ES, SG) of the safety PLC are designed in a way that the controller can receive the PNP output, as an input, from the terminal block TBEM. Considering this, you must connect the power (DC24V) of the PLC before using the safety inputs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a safety input is to be installed and used, the robot should be operated after confirming that the function works normally. This is an essential measure that must be taken in advance for the safety of workers.
{% endhint %}

\(2\) Emergency Stop Output

Emergency stop output is designed in a way that allows the controller to use the PNP output by turning it on or off when it is necessary for an external device to use the status of the emergency stop switch (on the operation panel, teach pendant, etc.) installed inside the controller.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an emergency stop output is to be installed and used, the robot should be operated after confirming that the emergency stop output operates normally. This is an essential measure that must be taken in advance for the safety of workers.

</table># 4.3.4. Amp Board (BD657T/BD658T)
# 4.3.4.1. BD658T/BD657T (앰프 보드)

The Amp Board performs a power amplification function that allows the current to flow to the individual phases of the motor according to the current command from the servo board. BD658T and BD657T enable simultaneous driving of 6 motors and are configured as follows.

The single-phase current supplied from the power supply module is rectified through a diode module and then converted into direct current and stored in a smoothing capacitor.

# 5.3. Remote IO
# 5.3.1. Overview

To use general IO signals in the Hi6 controller, you need the commercial remote IO. Basically, the commercial remote IO can be used by connecting an “IO module” (selected by the user) to one “communication module.” The module introduced below is a commercial remote IO module of Crevis, and you may purchase and use a commercial remote of other companies. For details on how to use each module, you are required to ask the company about the IO module you purchased.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fieldbus communication must be available to use the commercial remote IO. Therefore, you should configure the PCI communication card together by referring to “5.1 PCI Communication Card” mentioned above.

# 6. Periodic Inspections

The periodic inspection of the controller is designed to minimize the occurrence of failures and to maintain the performance continuously. This section describes the cautions and contents of works during the periodic inspection. # 6.1. Inspection Schedule 

Inspections should be carried out according to the schedule shown in the figure below. Periodic inspections are designed to prevent failures in advance and to secure safety and maintain accuracy even when the controller and manipulator are used for a long time. Periodic inspections are absolutely necessary and must be conducted even during normal operation.

![](../_assets/그림_6.1_점검_일정.png  )

Figure 6.1 Inspection Schedule
# 6.2. General Cautions for Periodic Inspections

* 	The inspection work should be conducted by a person who has completed the courses implemented at the robot training center by our company.

*	Before carrying out inspection works, check the parts, tools, drawings, etc. necessary for the work.

*	Use the specialized replacement parts designated by our company.

*	Turn off the power when inspecting the manipulator.

*	When conducting works while keeping the door open, turn off the primary power and take precautions to prohibit dust, etc. to fly into the surrounding area.

*	When required to touch the parts of the controller, you should take special care not to allow the IC to be destroyed by static electricity (Be careful also when contacting the connector).

*	When performing periodic inspections while operating the manipulator, take precautions to prohibit anyone from entering inside the operation range.

*	You should measure the voltage at a designated place and take precautions for electric shock and short-circuiting.

*	Do not inspect the robot and the controller at the same time. 

*	After inspection, you must perform a trial-operation to check the operation of the robot before performing the normal operation.

# 6.6. Inspection When Going on a Long Vacation

When going on a long vacation, you should check the following items first before turning off the controller of the robot.

(1)	Check whether the yellow LED (BATLOW) for battery discharge detection on the main board is turned on. The yellow LED will be turned on if there is a problem with the battery. In this case, replace the battery with a battery of rated capacity. If the controller input power is turned off while there is a problem with the battery, various programs and integer data in the board will be removed after about seven days. Therefore, you must back them up using HRView or a USB memory.

(2)	Check if the door of the controller is secured.

# 6.7. Maintenance Parts 

The characteristics of individual parts are described below. 

**Maintenance Parts of the Category A**

{% hint style="info" %}
These are the important parts to be prepared for daily maintenance and inspection.
