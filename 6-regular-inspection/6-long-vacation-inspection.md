# 6.6. Inspection When Going on a Long Vacation

When going on a long vacation, you should check the following items first before turning off the controller of the robot.

(1)	Check whether the yellow LED (BATLOW) for battery discharge detection on the main board is turned on. The yellow LED will be turned on if there is a problem with the battery. In this case, replace the battery with a battery of rated capacity. If the controller input power is turned off while there is a problem with the battery, various programs and integer data in the board will be removed after about seven days. Therefore, you must back them up using HRView or a USB memory.

(2)	Check if the door of the controller is secured.
