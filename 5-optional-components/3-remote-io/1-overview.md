# 5.3.1. Overview

To use general IO signals in the Hi6 controller, you need the commercial remote IO. Basically, the commercial remote IO can be used by connecting an “IO module” (selected by the user) to one “communication module.” The module introduced below is a commercial remote IO module of Crevis, and you may purchase and use a commercial remote of other companies. For details on how to use each module, you are required to ask the company about the IO module you purchased.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fieldbus communication must be available to use the commercial remote IO. Therefore, you should configure the PCI communication card together by referring to “5.1 PCI Communication Card” mentioned above.
