# 3.4. Storage of the Controller

When storing the controller, instead of installing it, refer to the following items.
*	Store the controller while keeping it in the packaged state and seal the power and communication connection parts tightly.

*	When storing the controller for a long time, you must take safety measures against the risk of it falling over.

*	When storing the controller wrapped in packing material, pack it with a desiccant or store it in a dry place. If it is stored in a highly humid place, moisture may form inside the packing material, damaging the product.

*	Avoid places where temperature and humidity may change easily (where condensation occurs) and store the controller in a cool, dry place where the ambient temperature ranges from -15 ℃ to 40 ℃.

*	Do not store the controller in locations where there are chemical products, acid and alkali products, batteries, circuit breakers, etc.
