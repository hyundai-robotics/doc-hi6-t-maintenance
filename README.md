# Hi6-T Controller Maintenance Manual

## Overview

The main purpose of this chapter is to describe the matters about the safety for the users of the industrial robot and for the workers who maintain and operate the robot.

Every worker who installs, replaces, adjusts, operate, preserves and maintains the robot system must carefully read and fully understand the operation manual and maintenance manual. Also, keep the manuals nearby so that you can view it whenever necessary.

Our company plans and implements the preservation, maintenance and operation trainings so the person using the robot should ensure that the workers working in the robot system should receive the relevant trainings. It must be ensured that only those who have completed this course can handle the robot.

The users of our industrial robots are responsible for surely understanding and complying with safety-related laws applicable in concerned countries and for properly designing, installing, and operating safety devices to protect workers working in robot systems.

The dangerous areas of the robot system, in other words, the areas where the robot, tools and peripheral devices are operating, should be equipped with safety devices according to ANSI / RIA R15.06-2012 to prevent an object, other than the workers and the workpiece, from entering the dangerous areas. The robot system should be configured in a way that it can be stopped immediately by an emergency stop device when a worker or object needs to enter the dangerous area in spite of possible danger. The workers are responsible for installing, checking and operating these safety devices.
