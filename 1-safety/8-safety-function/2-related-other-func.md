Required to fully understand the following items and take actions if a person is pinched due to an accident caused by the arm of the robot.

* Release of the manual brake 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Considering that additional problems may occur due to gravity or brake release, you must take a measure, before carrying out works, such as using a rope and crane that are to used for transportation of individual robots to prevent the brake from running down or additional accidents from taking place during the release of the brake.
{% endhint %}

    - After removing power from the controller, connect the brake release unit to the designated connector of the robot or the internal board connector of the controller and then release the manual brake for each axis as needed.

    - Refer to the maintenance manual of each robot for the information on individual axes of each robot, and for the designated transport equipment (ex: rope, crane) for each robot.

When the robot is stopped by the limit switch, it is possible to change the position by jogging the robot with the Teach pendant in the constant setting mode. After designating the soft limit according to the site situation, make sure that it is installed by a trained worker.

{% hint style="caution" %}
Our company is not responsible if the jogging operation does not work due to the failure of the hardware limit switch. 
You must check it periodically. For the measure to take in case of a failure, please refer to the troubleshooting manual.
