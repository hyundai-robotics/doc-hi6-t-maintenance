# 1.5. Potential Risks

If the results of the risk assessment of an integrated system linked to the robot reveal that the risk factors have not been sufficiently removed only with the safety-related functions of the robot, additional protective measures must be taken.
The items to take into consideration when establishing additional protective measures is as follows.
* During installation, fingers can be pinched (caught) between the robot base and the mounting table.
* Injuries (puncture wound, penetrating injury, etc.) from sharp edges or pointed parts of obstacles or tools in the operation area.
* Injuries (bruise, falling over, fracture, etc.) due to collision with the robot
* Injuries caused (puncture wound, penetrating injury, fracture, etc.) due to obstacles around the robot
* Injuries that may occur because the fastening part is not completely fixed
* Injuries (skin damage, shortness of breath, etc.) that may occur when working with toxic and hazardous substances
* Separation of a workpiece from the tool due to sudden power failure
* A mistake caused by confusing with the emergency stop switch of other equipment
* Errors due to arbitrary change of the setting of safety-related functions.
The type of risk that may occur depends on the system configuration, so you must conduct the risk assessment before using the integrated system.
