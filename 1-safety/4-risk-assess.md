# 1.4. Risk Assessment

When it comes to configuring an integrated system including a robot, risk assessment is one of the most critical factors that are handled as legal requirements in most countries. A risk assessment of an integrated system cannot be performed only on a single robot because the safety assessment for the installation of the will differ depending on how the robot is integrated into the system.

The system administrator should configure and operate the system according to the guidelines of ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 to conduct a risk assessment.
You should conduct the risk assessment by taking into account the entire process of an integrated system including the robot. The main objectives of the risk assessment are as follows.

* Basic settings for the use of the robot, and teaching of the robot
* Trouble diagnosis, and maintenance
* Normal operation of the installed robot

After installing the robot and configuring the s
ystem, you must conduct a risk assessment. The risk assessment mainly determines the appropriateness of safety devices in the robot integrated system, as well as the necessity for additional emergency stop devices and other safety devices. It is very important to know the appropriate safety devices and properly configure the robot integrated system. You should configure the integrated system by referring to the relevant information in the manual. For details on configuring the safety functions, refer to “1.8. Safety Functions”. In addition, when installing the robot in a specific location or configuring safety-related functions by using the safety I/O, the important items in the risk assessment of an integrated robot system are as follows.

* Severity
* Frequency of exposure to risks
* Possible occurrence
* Possible avoidance

In the process of configuring an integrated system, if the safety-related functions of the robot do not sufficiently eliminate the risk factors, it is possible to check the necessity for additional protective devices during the risk assessment.
