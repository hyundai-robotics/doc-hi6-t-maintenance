# 1.13.1. Safety Measures When Maintaining and Inspecting the Controller

Observe the following safety measures when maintaining and inspecting the robot controller.

* 	Maintenance and inspection works should be performed only by those who have received special maintenance trainings and fully understand the related contents.

*	Progress the work according to the controller maintenance and inspection procedures.

*	For the maintenance and inspection works, you must check the surroundings for safety and secure a passage or a place to avoid danger before progressing the work safely.

*	Must turn off the power before performing daily inspection or maintenance of the robot or replacement of parts. In addition, in order to prevent other workers from inadvertently turning on the power, put a warning marking such as [Power-On Prohibited] on the primary power supply. 

*	Always use the designated replacement parts. 

*	When required to open the controller door, you must turn off the power first and then wait for about 3 minutes before starting the work.

*	Use external lighting when sufficient illumination is not secured when performing maintenance and inspection works inside the controller.

*	Do not touch the heat sink and regenerative resistor of the servo amplifier because they generate excessive heat. After maintenance, check whether tools, foreign substances, etc. are left behind inside the controller, and then close the door securely.
