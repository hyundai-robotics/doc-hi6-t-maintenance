# 1.11.2. Safety Measures When Trial-Operating the Robot

{% hint style="caution" %}
In the case of trial-operation, there may be a design error, a teaching error, or a defect in manufacturing with regard to the entire system including the teaching program, jigs, and sequencing. For this reason, you should work with elevated safety awareness in trial-operation. Multiple factors can contribute to safety accidents. Observe the following measures considering that safety is very important when trial-operating the robot.
{% endhint %}

* 	Before operating the robot, check the functions of buttons such as the emergency stop button and the stop button as well as the functions of relevant signals. After that, check the operation related to detection of abnormality. First of all, it is important to check all the signals that stop the robot. When an accident is expected, the most important thing is to stop the robot.

*	When performing trial operation  of the robot, first set it to manual mode, input a job program with which you can test all axes, and then check the operation by repeating more than 1 cycle for each step While the robot is moving, open the safety guard or remove the enabling switch (enabling switch on the Teach pendant) to see whether the robot stop. If a problem is found, press the emergency stop button to check whether the robot stops. If the emergency stop device does not perform its function well, immediately shut off the main power. After that, you should call the responsible aftersales person. If there is no problem, increase the speed in sequence (50% → 75% → 100%), and check the operation by repeating more than 1 cycle each. Operating at high speed from the beginning may lead to a major accident.

*	It is not possible to predict what kind of problem will occur during trial-operation. Never enter inside the safety fence during trial-operation. As the reliability is low, it is very likely that unexpected accidents could occur
