# 1.11.3. Safety Measures for Auto Operation

Observe the following measures considering that safety is very important when operating the robot in auto mode.

* 	Put up a sign [No entry during operation] on the safety fence entrance and ask the worker to refrain from entering during operation. If the robot is stopped, you may enter inside the safety fence after judging the situation. 

*	When starting the auto operation, you must check whether there is a worker inside the safety fence. If you work without checking whether there is a worker inside, it may cause an accident involving people. 

*	When starting the auto operation, check first that that the program number, step number, mode, start selection, etc. are in proper state for auto operation. If you start the robot while an irrelevant program or step is selected, the robot may behave unexpectedly causing an accident. 

*	When starting the auto operation, check in advance that the robot is in the position where the robot can start the auto operation. Check also whether the program number or step number matches with the robot position. Even when the program or step is correct, if the robot is in a different position, an accident may occur due to an operation different from a normal operation 

*	Be prepared to press the emergency stop button immediately at the start of auto operation. If an unexpected robot operation or unexpected situation occurs, immediately press the emergency stop button. 

*	Check the operation path, operation status, and operation sound, etc. of the robot to judge whether there is any abnormal state. The robot may suddenly cause an abnormality such as a failure, but it may give some symptoms before the failure occurs. In order to predict this in advance, it is required to well understand the normal operation status of the robot. 

*	If any abnormality is found, immediately make an emergency stop and take proper measure for it. Using the robot without proper measures could lead to a severe failure that may lead to production interruption and significant accidents involving people. 

*	While completing measures and checking the operation after an abnormality occurred, do not operate the robot while the worker is still inside the safety fence. Unexpected accidents such as other abnormalities may occur as the reliability is low. 

*	Before selecting the auto mode, if there is a safety device function that has been stopped, you should progress works after recovering the function back to completely normal state.
