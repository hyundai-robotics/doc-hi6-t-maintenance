# 1.10.3. Installation of the Robot

{% hint style="warning" %}
The robot should be installed and operated according to the guidelines of ISO 10218-2. In addition, it is required to comply with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws. 
Our company (or the manufacturer) will not be responsible for any accidents that occur due to not complying with the relevant requirements of international standards and national laws or due to not reviewing the “risk assessment”.

Installation of the product should be performed by a qualified installer according to relevant national and local regulations and laws.

*	When unpacking the product, check it for damage that may occur while transporting or unpacking it.

*    Before installing the product after unpacking it, you must check the safety regulations, instructions, information related to the product installation and use environments, and fully understand the installation methods.

*	The worker who uses the robot should fully understand the contents described in the application and auxiliary manuals, and operate and handle the industrial robot skillfully.
*	The worker who installs the robot should be able to apply the safety instructions during the installation if there is a problem.
*	The system supplier should guarantee that all circuits used for safety functions perform their functions surely.
*	The main power supply to the robot should be installed in a way that it can be cut off from outside the robot operation area.
*	The system supplier should surely guarantee that all circuits used for safety functions perform their functions safely.
*	The emergency stop button should be located at a place where the worker can easily approach it when required to stop the robot urgently. 
*	By taking into consideration the dimensions of the manipulator and the operation range, make sure that that there is no interference with peripheral devices.
*	Avoid installing the robot in a place that is exposed to direct sunlight, has high level of humidity, has oil or chemicals around and has lots of metal powder or explosive gas in the air.
*	Install the robot in an area where the ambient temperature is 0 - 45 ℃.
*	Secure enough space for disassembling and inspecting the robot easily.
*	Install a safety fence and prevent people from entering the robot operation range.
*	Make sure there is no obstacle in the robot operation area.
*	When installing the robot in an area exposed to direct sunlight or near a heating element, you should take measures in consideration of the thermodynamic state of the controller.
*	Take additional measures when installing the robot in an area that has lots of dust such as metal powder in the air.
*	Carry out installation in a way that welding current never flows to the robot. In other words, there should be insulation between the spot gun and the wrist of the robot. 
*	Since grounding is important for preventing a malfunction due to noise and an electric shock, you should install the robot as shown below.

     - Install the dedicated grounding terminal while setting it as Type 3 Grounding higher.
     - Connect the grounding wire to the grounding bus bar inside the control panel.
     - When the manipulator is installed, if it is directly grounded to the floor by an anchor, etc., the controller side and the manipulator side will make a two-point grounding, forming a closed circuit, which conversely may cause malfunctioning due to some reasons such as noise. In this case, connect the grounding wire to the base part of the manipulator, but not to the controller side. In addition, if there is shaking when the robot stops, there is a high possibility that the grounding is incomplete or there is a closed circuit. It is required to check the grounding again.
     - If you use a gun with an embedded transformer, there is a risk of dropping because the primary power cable is connected directly to the spot gun. In this case, in order to protect the control panel and prevent electric shock, connect the grounding wire directly to the base part of the manipulator and do not connect it to the controller.<br/><br/>

* Carry out the installation by referring to the robot maintenance manual for each robot.
* After designating the soft limit suitable for the site situation, the positioning  and adjustment of the hardware limit must be performed by a trained worker. After installation, you must check whether the functions are working well.
