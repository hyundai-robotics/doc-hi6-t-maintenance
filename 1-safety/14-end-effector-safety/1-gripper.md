# 1.14.1. Gripper

* 	When a gripper is used to hold a workpiece, there should be a measure to take against abrupt dropping of the workpiece.

*	When installing the device onto an end effector or arm, you should use the bolts of specified sizes and the specified number of bolts, and tighten them completely according to regulated torques by using torque wrenches. You should use bolts that are not rusted or stained.

*	When manufacturing an end effector, you should take into account that it can be used within the allowable load value of the wrist of the robot. An end effector should have a structure that will not allow a gripped material to be released or dropped even when the power supply or air supply is interrupted, and the corners and protrusions should be surely treated in order to prevent people or objects from suffering any damage.
