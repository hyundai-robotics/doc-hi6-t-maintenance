# 1.14.2. Tools/Workpieces

* 	It should be possible to safely change tools such as a milling cutter. Until the cutter stops rotating, the safety devices should surely perform proper functions.

*	The tool should be designed in a way that the workpiece will not have any abnormality even when a sudden power failure or control failure occurs. In manual operation, it should be possible to separate the workpiece.
